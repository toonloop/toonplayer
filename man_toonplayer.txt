[OPERATION]
Toonplayer is a looping movie clips player. It is intended to be used to display clips made with the Toonloop live stop motion animation software. All the movie files should be in the same directory, and their name should end with ".mov". The path to the directory where these files are located shoud be given as a first argument to the command. If not given, it defaults to ~/Documents/toonplayer if it exists. If the latter directory does not exist, it will use the current working directory. There must be files whose name end with ".mov" in that directory, otherwise, Toonplayer will complain and exit. 

Toonloop saves its clips using the Motion-JPEG codec in the Quicktime container. They have no sound. Toonplayer uses Gstreamer to play those clips in a window. 

[GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE]

Press the Escape keyboard key to toggle on/off the fullscreen mode.

You can pause and resume the clips being played. The clips change every several seconds to the next one in the clips directory.
